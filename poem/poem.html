    <h1>The Code's Journey</h1>
    <h2>A <strong>100-word</strong> poem about coding evolution</h2>
    
    <p>
        From punch cards dancing through mechanical minds,<br>
        To <b>FORTRAN's</b> first whispered commands,<br>
        We traced electric pathways through silicon valleys,<br>
        Teaching machines our human plans.
    </p>

    <p>
        Basic gave way to object-oriented dreams,<br>
        While the web spun its global thread.<br>
        JavaScript breathed life into static pages,<br>
        As mobile apps filled screens instead.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now <em>AI</em> writes its own algorithms,<br>
        Neural networks learn and grow.<br>
        In fifty years, we'll speak intentionsâ€”<br>
        Pure thought to digital flow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Code will vanish behind interfaces,<br>
        Quantum bits will dance unseen.<br>
        Programming becomes conversation,<br>
        Human dreams through&nbsp;machine.
