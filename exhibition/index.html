                <p>In physics, the observer effect describes how the act of measurement fundamentally changes what is being measured. This exhibition applies that principle to the networked self, presenting four works from 2007–2014 that interrogate how watching and being watched online transforms both observer and observed.</p>
                
                <p>During this pivotal period, social media transitioned from novelty to infrastructure, and these artists were among the first to critically examine its psychological toll. Amalia Ulman's fabricated Instagram breakdown revealed how audiences project meaning onto curated personas. Wafaa Bilal made observation violent and literal, allowing online viewers to physically assault him with a paintball gun. Ann Hirsch discovered that performing confidence for strangers actually made her confident—the mask became the face. Kristin Lucas took this transformation to its logical extreme, legally "refreshing" her identity as one would a webpage.</p>
                
                <p>Together, these works expose the internet not as a passive window but as a force that reshapes identity, erodes the boundary between performance and selfhood, and implicates all of us as both watchers and watched. <span class="highlight">The screen is not neutral. To observe is to act.</span></p>
